# Criterion Top 10 Dataset

*Last updated, 8/2/2022.*

Dataset of the "Top 10" lists from the criterion website, at https://www.criterion.com/current/top-10-lists/.

## CSV formatting

The CSV delimiter is `;` to avoid conflicts with films that are named with commas.

Some films are tied with other films; these are indexed under its placements and the films are seperated by `|`.

Each row represents the list that the contributor has given.

## Notes

Not all the contributors have submitted exactly 10 films. Some are tied, few mention non-criterion films,
(e.g. Christopher Nolan and *Greed (1924)* (Erich von Stroheim) for 10^th place).
